# Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Science portfolio! This repository contains a collection of projects and assignments completed as part of the **IBM Data Science Professional Certificate** on Coursera. Here, you will find a range of projects that demonstrate my skills and knowledge in the field of data science.

## Contents

- **Data Wrangling & Cleaning**: Projects focused on preparing and transforming data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing and summarizing datasets to uncover insights.
- **Machine Learning**: Building predictive models using machine learning algorithms.
- **Data Visualization**: Using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to create compelling visualizations.
- **SQL & Database Management**: Querying and manipulating data stored in databases.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn, TensorFlow
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- SQL
- Jupyter Notebooks

## How to Run the Projects

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-science-portfolio.git
2. Install the required libraries (if using a virtual environment, make sure itâ€™s activated):

bash
Code kopieren
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Navigate to the project folder and open the corresponding Jupyter notebook or Python script to explore the work.

About Me
I am a data science enthusiast actively developing my skills in data manipulation, machine learning, and data visualization. I am currently working through the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate and am excited to continue learning and applying my knowledge to real-world data problems.

Feel free to check out the projects and reach out if you have any questions!
