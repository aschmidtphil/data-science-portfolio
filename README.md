Welcome to my **Data Science Portfolio**! This repository showcases a collection of projects and assignments completed as part of the **IBM Data Science Professional Certificate** on Coursera. These projects demonstrate my skills and expertise in various areas of data science, from data cleaning to machine learning.

---

## üìÇ Contents

### 1. **Data Wrangling & Cleaning**

- Projects focused on preparing, cleaning, and transforming raw data for analysis.

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

- Visualizing and summarizing datasets to uncover patterns and insights.

### 3. **Machine Learning**

- Building and evaluating predictive models using machine learning algorithms.

### 4. **Data Visualization**

- Creating compelling visualizations with tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.
  #### Example: **Schelling Word Cloud**
  One of my favorite visualizations is a **Schelling Word Cloud**, created from my dissertation on philosophy. This word cloud demonstrates how I integrate my background in philosophy with my newly acquired Python skills. By processing the text and visualizing the frequency of key terms, I highlighted the core concepts of Schelling‚Äôs work in a visually engaging way.



  This project underscores my ability to bridge interdisciplinary domains and apply data visualization techniques to communicate insights effectively.

### 5. **SQL & Database Management**

- Querying and manipulating data stored in relational databases.
